## Who are you ?

I am Dawei Guo(郭大卫).

Currently studying at [San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). Previously living in [Beijing](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E5%B8%82%E6%B5%B7%E6%B7%80%E5%8D%80). Everyday struggling with despair.

Indie-Rock is awesome, isn' it?

## Why *"MroNak"* ?

It comes from my favorite Zenyatta Player [JJoNak](https://liquipedia.net/overwatch/JJoNak). JJoNak means "fumbling octopus" in Korean. Anyway, I change a little bit (just 2 letters) to make it my own identifier :/
